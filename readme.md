# Adaptive Robot Path Planning (CS 4180/5180: Reinforcement Learning and Sequential Decision Making, Fall 2023)

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning model for navigating a robot through a dynamic environment with moving obstacles to reach a designated target point. The project explores the use of Q-Learning and Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms for this task.
