## Here's a deeper dive based on recent works and projects in this domain:

### Performance Comparison between Algorithms:
A study found that by integrating reinforcement learning, the convergence time in robot path planning increased by 13.54% when compared to just using Q-Learning and A3C algorithms. Moreover, when a neural network algorithm was added to Q-Learning, the convergence time shot up by 33.85%, indicating a significant improvement in performance​.

### Algorithm Improvements:
Various papers propose improvements to the traditional Q-Learning algorithm to address its slow convergence speed in discrete states. For instance, a paper introduced an enhanced Step Batch Q-Learning algorithm to tackle this issue, which significantly sped up the convergence time by enabling early detection of obstacles and target points, thus reducing the number of iterations required​2​.
Another paper focused on modifying the exploration strategy in Q-learning to balance between exploration and exploitation during the path planning process, which is crucial to avoid getting stuck in local optima​3​.

### ROS in Path Planning:
ROS (Robot Operating System) has been employed in various studies for real-time path planning. For instance, a project demonstrated a Real-Time Path Planning Algorithm based on ROS for mobile robots​4​.
Another study proposed a global path planning method for autonomous ground robots using ROS with a pre-built map of the environment to tackle the issue of local minima​5​.
There's also a noteworthy paper that reviews three different types of path planning algorithms using ROS: Generalized Voronoi Diagrams (GVD), Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT), and the Gradient Descent Algorithm (GDA)​6​.

### Specific Techniques in ROS:
A particular technique was proposed where ROS's path planning was based on 2D Lidar-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), showcasing high coverage and strong environmental adaptability in simulation tests​7​.
